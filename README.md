# QC-Math-project
Additional math project for the course Quantum Communication and Cryptography.
The script [run_simulations.py](run_simulations.py) uses the templates in this main folder to set up a series of repeater nodes in the folder [app](app/) and then runs simulations.

[The report for this project can be found here](Rik%20Ledoux%20wiskunde%20eindwerkstuk.pdf)
